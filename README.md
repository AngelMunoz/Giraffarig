# Giraffarig!

This is a F# Skeleton for some of my personal projects using .net core and Giraffe.

### Things to do after cloning
- Don't forget to rename your `Giraffarig` references yo your project's name
- Change your Enviromental Variables/Variables names in `Properties/launchSettings.json` and inside the code
- Change your Database Name in `Db.fs`


#### Disclaimer
I'm not good at F#, and I think this language finally clicked on me, with this sample API.
I think I should be able to start digging deeper into F# for more use cases than just a simple Jwt Login now.

#### Found Something Wrong?
I do intend to learn F# more, but first of all I'm not much into mystic currying/partial application/composition (just about enough) so be gentle with me.

That being said, please feel free to raise an issue and point out bad patterns you might spot as well as bugs
